I am a career Software Engineer and martial artist on the United States Martial Arts Team (having the honor of holding
two World Championship titles.)

I have been a technology enthusiast ever since I got my first computer, and Atari 800, and have had a passion for
software development ever since I wrote my own word processor for my TI-80 calculator in basic.
